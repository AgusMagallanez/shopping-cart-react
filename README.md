- HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the application.
- CSS: The styling language used to define the appearance and layout of HTML elements.
- React Hooks: The app utilizes various React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer to manage component state, side effects, and context data efficiently.

## Deployment
